# Romulus source code

This repo contains the code source of Romulus, as it was provided to me by F0XHOUND on 24/03/2023.

It was developped using Delphi 7. F0XHOUND has declared the project as abandoned so this repo has been created to archive & preserve its code source.

If you want to modify it feel free to fork this repo, I will not handle any issues/merge requests here.

There is a compiled version that you can still download using [this website](https://romulus.dats.site/).
